----------
sample model defined - example  Paramicons.kt defines requirements of Paramicons project
   field paramicons brings everything together
TODO add db
This model omits:
    the concept of Path which is need for fine grained security and query definition
    the concept of id for model elements which is probably important for versioning
The schema is defined by Entity and Connection s between them.
